/**
 * Command controller: the only way screens dispatch game actions.
 *
 * - **Stale-view guard.** `capture()` binds a dispatcher to the committed revision and to a
 *   view generation when a screen renders. Any newer view (a commit or a restore, even one with
 *   the same numeric revision) makes older dispatchers refuse with `StaleCommandError`, and the
 *   runtime refuses a mismatched `expectedRevision` before any rule runs.
 * - **Strict durability.** After a failed checkpoint, `retry()` asks the runtime to retry the
 *   exact failed write, then continues an accepted multi-turn action with `continuePending()`.
 *   The original action is never dispatched again.
 * - **Pause.** `resume(reason)` removes one pause reason and continues accepted work.
 *
 * Ported from the Aegis reference shell (poc/lab-shared/commands.ts).
