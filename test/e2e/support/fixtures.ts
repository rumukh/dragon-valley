/**
 * The `test` every Dragon Valley end-to-end spec imports. It is Playwright's `test` plus the
 * automatic `guard` fixture (support/guard.ts): every test, in every engine, fails if the game
 * wrote to the console, threw, made a failed or foreign request, linked out, opened a window,
 * sent a beacon, violated its CSP or navigated away. Tests that provoke one of these on purpose
 * say so with `guard.allow(...)`.
