/**
 * What the suite knows is wrong, and tolerates on purpose.
 *
 * - KNOWN_ISSUES: guard findings that are not the game's doing (engine noise), by engine.
 * - DEFECTS: product defects found by this suite and routed to their owner through the
 *   coordinator (docs/qa/defects.md). A test states the behaviour it wants and wraps that one
 *   assertion in `unlessKnown(...)`: while the defect reproduces, the test records it as an
 *   annotation and carries on; once the fix lands the assertion simply passes and the report says
 *   the marker can go. Nothing here hides a failure that is not listed.
 *
 * Accessibility findings that are tracked defects live in `a11y.ts` (KNOWN_AXE).
